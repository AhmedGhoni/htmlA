                Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
                <br>
                The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.

               <b>what is artificial intelligenceAt it's core</b> , AI is the branch of computer    science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the      endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.<br>

                The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.<br>  

                The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?<br>

                In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines. With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii)<br>

                Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI:
            </p>
    
             <ol>
                <li>Thinking humanly</li>
                <li>Thinking rationally</li>
                <li>Acting humanly </li>
                <li>Acting rationally</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior.

                <b>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: </b>
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Narrow AI:</b> Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence.

                <li>
                    <b>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</b> AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem.
